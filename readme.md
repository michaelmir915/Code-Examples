# Sample Code for Michael Mirhosseini

Welcome to my GitHub repository of sample code. This collection includes segments of code from various projects I have worked on in the past, mostly academically.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my coding abilities. Due to academic honesty policies and client confidentiality agreements, most of the code provided is either incomplete or missing necessary files, making it non-executable.

## Contents

This repository includes:
- **C Files**: Contains code for a 4-bit multiplier designed to work on an FPGA board. Some parts of the code were provided as starter code, such as #include statements and a portion of 'multiplier.c'.
- **C++ Files**: Includes the Rule of Five implementation for a doubly linked list and some code for a larger project involving a minimum priority queue based on a linked list.
- **Go File**: Contains the backend of a Go script that uses RESTful API to update a MySQL database. This code has many print or test statements left in but commented out at the request of the client.
- **Python Files**: Includes three image processing scripts and one file related to my research. While I cannot share most of the research code, I have included functions for extracting data from a MATLAB file and performing cross-correlation on the data with and without overlap. I am happy to discuss the project further but unable to provide more code.

## Usage

While the code in this repository does not run on its own, you can explore the structure and logic of the projects. I would be happy to discuss the projects or code in more detail if requested.
